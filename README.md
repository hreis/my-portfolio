# Portfolio 

> This is a funny page about me..

Well, I enjoyed the little free time to improve some techniques about css and html to show a little bit about me and my work experience

## Development server

```sh
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
```

## Code scaffolding

```sh
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
```

## Build

```sh
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
```

## Running unit tests

```sh
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
```

## Running end-to-end tests

```sh
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
```

## Further help

```sh
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
```
